	<h1> For a better day</h1>
	<br> Paint on a caution wind 
    <br>'Neath the bleeding sky
    <br> I called your name
    <br> There was no one there
    <br> And in the cold and snow
    <br> I saw your face
    <p>

    <br> And we sang that song for the little thing
    <br>  Magic calm, but the joy you bring
    <br>Running it down the line
    <br>Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
    <br>Magic gone from a pretty thing
    <br> Maybe it might be time
    <br>     For a better day
     <br>    For a better day
     <br>    For a better day
    </p>
    <p>
    <br> Straight from the path of love
    <br> In the road of life
    <br> I tumble forward
    <br> But I'm going on
    <br>  I'ma keep it strong
    <br> I saw your face
    <br>And we sang that song for the little thing
    <br> Magic calm, but the joy you bring
    <br>Running it down the line
    <br>Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
    <br> Magic gone from a pretty thing
    <br>Maybe it might be time
    <br>For a better day
    <br>For a better day
    <br>For a better day
    <br> For a better day
    <br>For a better day
    <br>For a better day 
</p>
